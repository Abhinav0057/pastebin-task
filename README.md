# pastebin-task

## Used selenium to extract the data after the dom manipulation from JSX

## I have used a while loop so that we can get top 30 results 
## A logic to check past json length and write after could have been implemented but it wont give top results and may cause duplication
## A json file with html fields is saved directly
